InfoPinStrap is a website on the similar lines of Pinterest with a new category - Events.
It allows user to pin or add news articles, cooking recipes and events around a user to his/her board in their profile for future reference. I also allows users to follow other users, like other user's saved boards/pins and add comments on the same.
